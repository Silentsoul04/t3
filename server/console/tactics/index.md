# Tactics


 IR must actively interpret events to solve problems under stress and various time constraints. Therefore, our goal is to constantly develop and improve our competence in---and ultimately master---DFIR skill sets, including:

Deny adversary opportunities to attack
Identify and counter use of offensive techniques
Evaluate the success and impact of adversary actions
Explain logic and intent of adversary actions and decisions

Start with knowledge, build that knowledge into skills using practical application, and constantly refine these skills through practice and testing. This will improve each skill individually as well as your ability to integrate and interface between different skill sets with speed and accuracy.

Training labs are a learning tool that can increase your understanding of adversary approaches and attacks. Emulation and practical application improves your ability to correctly identify and address them during an incident.

Build your skills and confidence in identifying and understanding offensive tools, techniques, and strategies.
