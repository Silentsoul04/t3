To retrieve generated/fake data for a timestamp see the following capabilities:


```python
from socfaker import SocFaker

sc = SocFaker()

print(sc.timestamp.in_the_past())
print(sc.timestamp.in_the_future())
print(sc.timestamp.current)
```

## Timestamp Class

```eval_rst
.. automodule:: socfaker.timestamp
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
```
